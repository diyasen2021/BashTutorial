# Introduction to Bash 

Welcome to our beginner's Bash tutorial! Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a powerful command-line shell that allows you to interact directly with your computer's operating system. With Bash, you can navigate your file system, manipulate files, automate tasks, and much more. Whether you're a developer, data scientist, or just someone curious about command-line skills, understanding Bash is an essential skill that can make your computer work for you in powerful ways.

### Getting started with Bash

**On MacOSX:**

Open **Finder**. <br>
Go to **Applications** > **Utilities**. <br> 
Double-click on **Terminal**.<br>

Alternatively, use **Spotlight Search**. <br>
Press Command + Space to open **Spotlight**. <br>
Type **"Terminal"** and press Enter.<br>


**Setting Up Your Bash Environment (Optional)** <br>
For many users, macOS comes pre-configured with a .bash_profile and .bashrc file. These files allow you to set environment variables, aliases, and custom configurations.<br>
To check if these files exist:<br>
