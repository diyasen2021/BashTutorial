# What is a shell and why should you learn to use it in Bioinformatics ?
A shell is a computer program that presents a command line interface which allows you to communicate with Unix and Linux operating systems. 
There are many reasons to learn about the shell:

**Essential for Bioinformatics** Many bioinformatics tools are accessible only through the command line. Others offer extended functionalities and configuration options that aren't available in their graphical interfaces. For example, advanced features in BLAST can only be accessed if youâ€™re comfortable with the shell.

**Efficiency in Repetitive Tasks** Bioinformatics often involves working with large sets of data files, requiring repetitive actions. Using the shell, you can automate these tasks, saving time and enabling you to focus on more engaging parts of your work.

**Improved Accuracy** Repeating tasks manually, especially across many files, can lead to mistakes. However, a computer can execute the same operation hundreds or thousands of times without error, helping you avoid human mistakes. The shell makes your work more reproducible. When you carry out your work in the command-line (rather than a GUI), your computer keeps a record of every step that you've carried out, which you can use to re-do your work when you need to. It also gives you a way to communicate unambiguously what you've done, so that others can inspect or apply your process to new data.

**Access to Powerful Computing** Many bioinformatics analyses require significant computing resources, beyond the capabilities of a personal computer. These processes are often run on remote or cloud-based systems, which are accessed through the shell.

# How to access the shell locally
On a Mac or Linux machine, you can access a shell through a program called "Terminal", which is already available on your computer. The Terminal is a window into which we will type commands. If you're using Windows, you'll need to download a separate program to access the shell.

# How to access the shell on AWS
To save time, we are going to be working on a remote server where all the necessary data and software available. When we say a 'remote server', we are talking about a computer that is not the one you are working on right now. 
You will access the Carpentries remote server where everything is prepared for the lesson. We will learn the basics of the shell by manipulating some data files. Some of these files are very large , and would take time to download to your computer. We will also be using several bioinformatic packages in later lessons and installing all of the software would take up time even more time. A 'ready-to-go' server lets us focus on learning.
